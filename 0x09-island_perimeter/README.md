# 0x09-island_perimeter

## overview:
For the “0. Island Perimeter” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.

## Concepts Needed:
<ol>
  <li>
    2D Arrays (Matrices):
    <ul>
      <li>
        Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
      </li>
      <li>
Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Conditional Logic:
      <ul>
      <li>Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Counting Techniques:
      <ul>
      <li>Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Problem-Solving Strategies:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Python Programming:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
      </li>
        <li>
Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
          </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
